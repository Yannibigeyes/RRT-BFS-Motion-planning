## Notes
I'm the creator of this repo. This project is finished in a Robot Motion Planning course in Georgia Tech. All the codes were written by me, and I own the complete copyright.

## Environment
Python 3.6

## Getting started
Run main.py and it would automatically run RRT model to explore paths to reach out the goal and then apply BFS (visited-list) to output the shortest path.
